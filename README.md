📚 AI-Powered Study Video Generator
Turn your class notes into fun, animated lessons.
📌 Overview

This project transforms real classroom materials—notes, study guides, review packets, and slides—into short, engaging cartoon-style videos designed to help students understand and retain key concepts.

Instead of reading through dozens of pages before a test, students get a custom AI-generated lesson crafted specifically from the material their teacher provided.

🎯 Mission

Make studying more engaging, less overwhelming, and way more effective.

Education often feels:

Boring

Dense

Hard to focus on

Time-consuming

This tool flips studying upside down by converting traditional text-based materials into a visual, story-driven learning experience.

🧠 Core Idea

Upload any study material → Get back an animated teaching video tailored to your exam content.

The system extracts what matters, explains it in simple terms, and delivers it like a cartoon lesson — fun, memorable, and easy to follow.

✨ MVP Features
✔️ Upload Class Material

Students can upload:

PDFs

Writeups

Slides

Review packets

Typed notes

✔️ Intelligent Study Extraction

The AI:

Reads and understands the uploaded files

Detects important topics, definitions, formulas, and themes

Removes filler and duplicate information

Prioritizes what is most likely to be on a test

✔️ Structured Teaching Plan

The system converts raw info into a clear lesson format:

Organized outline

Major concepts explained simply

Examples and model answers (if relevant)

Common mistakes to avoid

End-of-lesson summary

✔️ Animated Lesson Generation

The platform writes and generates:

A friendly, conversational teaching script

Scene-based 2D animation with simple characters

Voice narration synced to visuals

On-screen captions + key callouts

Result:
A fun video that teaches the student only what they need to know.

✔️ Extra Study Resources

Along with the video, students receive:

A key-points cheat sheet

Optional auto-generated review questions
